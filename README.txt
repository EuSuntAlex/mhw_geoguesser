Hello! This is a GeoGuessr like game! 
By pressing the Start Game button, you go into the default game. An image will be presented and you need to guess the platform and the location of that photo. If you get the location right, points will be added to your score based on how close u were to the right answer! There will be 10 rounds.

The Easy Mode, shows you a zoomed in photo. You will have 6 options to choose from. If you get it right on your first try you get 2 points, if not, only 1. If u guess wrong 3 times, you will lose one of your 3 lives. 

Good luck!

Also, don't forget to check it "Cool People" section!
