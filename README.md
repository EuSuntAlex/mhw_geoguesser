## How the Setup Was Created

To create the setup, I followed these steps:  
1. Created an executable file using **PyInstaller**.  
2. Applied a certificate (self-signed) in the hope of reducing the likelihood of the file being flagged as a virus.  
3. Used **Inno Setup** to package everything into a single installer.

To ensure the integrity of the setup executable, here is its **SHA-256 hash**:  
üîπ **SHA-256:** `6b18379538df3c450579446f378f567502b2b0b848978142faa274dee98047c3`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

You may encounter a **Windows security warning** during installation. Unfortunately, the only way to proceed is to add the file to your antivirus's trusted list. I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. If you know of a better solution, please let me know!  

This issue arises because the setup is an executable and includes all necessary dependencies for users who don‚Äôt have Python installed. If you have any concerns, you can always download the game directly from the GitHub repository to verify its integrity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Resolution Warning

This game is designed to work optimally on a **1920x1080 resolution**. If you notice certain items appearing off-center or misaligned, it‚Äôs likely due to playing on a different resolution. I apologize for this limitation and appreciate your understanding.

Happy playing! üéÆ
